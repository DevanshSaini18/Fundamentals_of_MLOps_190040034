# PART 1
#### 1) Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations, or AIOps, is another paradigm shift that allows machines to solve IT issues by themselves instead of requiring human assistance. It is a multi-layered technology that enhances the operations of IT. AIOps uses machine learning and analytics to analyze big data obtained via different tools. This allows the platform to automatically spot and react to IT issues in realtime. It works as continuous integration and deployment for the core technology functions in machine learning and big data.
#### Now the question is why your organization requires AIOps. Statistics suggest that 72% of IT organizations rely on different IT monitoring tools to support modern applications! Obviously businesses require these tools to manage day to day IT operations.
#### AIOps is all about supporting and reacting to its issues in real-time and providing analytics to your operations teams. These functions include performance monitoring, event analysis, correlation, and IT automation. According to Gartner, AIOps combines big data and machine learning to automate IT operations processes. Therefore, the end goal of AIOps is to automatically spot issues in day-to-day IT operations and proactively react to them using Artificial Intelligence.
#### MLOps, on the other hand, focuses on managing training and testing data that is needed to create machine learning models effectively. It is all about monitoring and management of ML models. It focuses on the Machine Learning operationalization pipeline. AIOps is all about applying cognitive computing techniques to improve IT operations, but it is not to be confused with MLOps.
### 2) The degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision. The higher the interpretability of a machine learning model, the easier it is for someone to comprehend why certain decisions or predictions have been made.And Linear regression does a good job in providing us correlation between our result and our features through its weights. If weight of the feature is high then that means our output greatly epends on that feature.
